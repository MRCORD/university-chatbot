# Engine Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The University Chatbot features a **provider-agnostic** modular conversation engine architecture designed for maximum flexibility and extensibility. The system is built with clean separation of concerns, dependency injection, and well-defined interfaces that allow for easy swapping of different conversation engines and providers.

**Current Implementation**: While the architecture supports multiple conversation engines, the current implementation uses **LangGraph** as the primary engine provider. This demonstrates the system's capability to integrate sophisticated workflow orchestration while maintaining provider independence.

## Provider-Agnostic Design Philosophy

The engine architecture is intentionally decoupled from specific providers to ensure:

- **Flexibility**: Easy migration between different conversation engines (LangGraph, LangChain, custom implementations)
- **Vendor Independence**: No lock-in to specific LLM providers, vector databases, or orchestration frameworks
- **Extensibility**: Simple addition of new engines without architectural changes
- **Testing**: Ability to use mock implementations for all provider interactions

## Architecture Components

    ├── utils/          # Engine utilities
    └── workflows/      # Workflow orchestration
```

### 2. Engine Interface

The engine implements the `ConversationEngine` interface defined in `app/interfaces/conversation_engine.py`. This interface serves as the **provider-agnostic contract** that any conversation engine implementation must fulfill, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of the underlying technology.

#### Key Components:
- **ConversationContext**: Contains user context, session info, and conversation history
- **ConversationResponse**: Structured response with metadata, sources, and confidence scores
- **QueryType**: Enumeration of supported query types (document QA, complaints, general info, procedures)

#### Main Methods:
- `process_query()`: Main entry point for processing user messages
- `initialize_documents()`: Setup document knowledge base
- `health_check()`: Engine health monitoring

**Provider Independence**: Any conversation engine (LangGraph, LangChain, custom implementations) can be plugged in by implementing this interface.

### 3. ModularLangGraphEngine (Current Implementation)

The current engine implementation (`app/engines/langgraph/engine.py`) demonstrates how the provider-agnostic architecture works in practice. This **LangGraph-specific implementation** acts as a coordinator that:

1. **Sets up tools** - Service wrappers for document search, user management, etc.
2. **Sets up nodes** - Individual processing steps in the workflow
3. **Sets up workflow** - Orchestrates the conversation flow
4. **Processes conversations** - Executes the complete pipeline

#### Initialization Flow:
```python
def __init__(self, services: Dict[str, Any], providers: Dict[str, Any]):
    self.services = services      # DocumentService, UserService, etc.
    self.providers = providers    # LLMProvider, DatabaseProvider, etc.
    
    self.tools = self._setup_tools()        # Create service wrappers
    self.nodes = self._setup_nodes()        # Create workflow nodes
    self.workflow = self._setup_workflow()  # Create orchestration
```

### 4. LangGraph-Specific Components (Current Implementation)

The following components are specific to the **LangGraph implementation** and demonstrate how provider-specific features can be integrated while maintaining the agnostic architecture:

#### State Management (`app/engines/langgraph/state/`)
- **LangGraph-specific state object** that flows through the workflow
- **Thread-safe state transitions** between workflow nodes
- **Provider-specific state handling** while implementing generic interfaces

#### Workflow Nodes (`app/engines/langgraph/nodes/`)
- **LangGraph workflow nodes** implementing specific processing steps
- **Provider-agnostic interfaces** with LangGraph-specific implementations
- **Modular design** allowing easy replacement with other provider implementations

#### Workflow Orchestration (`app/engines/langgraph/workflows/`)
- **LangGraph-specific workflow definition** and execution
- **Graph-based conversation flow** management
- **Conditional routing** and error handling specific to LangGraph

**Note**: These components showcase how provider-specific features can be leveraged while maintaining the overall agnostic design. Other conversation engine providers would have their own equivalent implementations.

### 5. State Management

#### ConversationState (`app/engines/langgraph/state/`)
- **Central state object** that flows through the entire workflow
- **Tracks conversation context**, user intents, retrieved documents
- **Maintains processing metadata** and intermediate results
- **Thread-safe state transitions** between workflow nodes

#### StateManager
- **Initializes conversation state** from user input and context
- **Manages state transitions** between workflow steps
- **Handles state validation** and error recovery

### 6. Workflow Nodes

Individual processing steps located in `app/engines/langgraph/nodes/`:

#### Classification Node (`classification.py`)
- **Analyzes user intent** using LLM
- **Determines query type** (document QA, complaint, general info)
- **Routes conversation** to appropriate processing path

#### Document Search Node (`document_search.py`)
- **Performs semantic search** on document knowledge base
- **Retrieves relevant context** for user queries
- **Ranks and filters results** by relevance

#### Complaint Processing Node (`complaint_processing.py`)
- **Handles complaint submissions** and processing
- **Validates complaint data** structure
- **Integrates with complaint management** system

#### Response Formatting Node (`response_formatting.py`)
- **Formats final response** using LLM
- **Incorporates retrieved context** and sources
- **Ensures response quality** and consistency

### 7. Workflow Orchestration

#### Chat Workflow (`app/engines/langgraph/workflows/chat_workflow.py`)
- **Defines conversation flow** between nodes
- **Handles conditional routing** based on user intent
- **Manages error handling** and fallback scenarios
- **Coordinates state transitions** through the pipeline

#### Workflow Execution Flow:
```
User Query → State Initialization → Classification → Document Search 
    ↓
Response Formatting ← Context Retrieval ← Intent Processing
    ↓
Final Response → User
```

### 8. Tools Integration

Tools in `app/engines/langgraph/tools/` wrap services for workflow integration:

- **Document tools** - Search and retrieval operations
- **User tools** - User management and authentication
- **Complaint tools** - Complaint processing and validation
- **General tools** - Utility functions and helpers

### 9. Engine Factory (Provider Management)

The `ConversationEngineFactory` (`app/engines/factory.py`) is the **key component for provider management**:

- **Provider-agnostic instantiation** - Creates engines based on configuration
- **Dependency injection** for services and providers
- **Engine selection** through environment variables or configuration
- **Singleton management** for engine instances
- **Environment-specific setup** (development, production)

**Switching Providers**: To use a different conversation engine, simply:
1. Implement the `ConversationEngine` interface
2. Register the new engine in the factory
3. Update configuration to select the new provider

## Alternative Provider Examples

The provider-agnostic architecture supports various conversation engine implementations:

### Potential Engine Providers
- **LangGraph** (Current): Advanced workflow orchestration with state management
- **LangChain**: Traditional chain-based conversation flows

### Provider Selection Strategy
The architecture allows for:
- **Development environments**: Mock or lightweight implementations
- **Testing environments**: Controlled providers for consistent testing
- **Production environments**: High-performance, scalable providers
- **A/B testing**: Multiple providers running simultaneously for comparison

### Migration Benefits
- **Zero service disruption**: Switch providers without changing business logic
- **Performance optimization**: Choose the best provider for specific workloads
- **Cost optimization**: Migrate to more cost-effective solutions
- **Feature utilization**: Leverage provider-specific capabilities when needed

## Provider-Agnostic Processing Flow

### 1. Query Processing Pipeline

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Query] --> B[Initialize State]
    B --> C[Classify Intent]
    C --> D{Query Type?}
    D -->|Document QA| E[Search Documents]
