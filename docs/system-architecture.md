## High-Level Architecture

The University Chatbot system follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns, enabling maintainability, scalability, and testability. The architecture is designed around the principle of **provider agnosticism**, allowing for easy swapping of external services and implementations.

### Architectural Layers Overview

The system is organized into five distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities:

1. **Client Layer**: User-facing interfaces and applications
2. **API Gateway**: Request routing, middleware, and protocol handling
3. **Business Logic Layer**: Core application logic and conversation processing
4. **Data Access Layer**: Database operations and data persistence
5. **Provider Layer**: External service integrations and abstractions

### Key Architectural Principles

- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules; both depend on abstractions
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has a single, well-defined purpose
- **Open/Closed Principle**: System is open for extension but closed for modification
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients depend only on interfaces they use
- **Loose Coupling**: Components are minimally dependent on each other

4. **Hot Swapping**: Runtime switching between providers for A/B testing or failover

## Data Flow

Understanding the data flow through the University Chatbot system is crucial for comprehending how user requests are processed and responses are generated. The system implements two primary data flow patterns: request processing and conversation processing.

### 1. Request Processing Flow

The request processing flow handles all incoming HTTP requests, from initial reception to final response delivery. This flow ensures proper authentication, validation, and error handling for all API interactions.

#### Flow Stages

1. **Request Reception**: Client sends HTTP request to FastAPI application
2. **Authentication**: Middleware validates JWT tokens and user permissions
3. **Request Validation**: Pydantic models validate request structure and data types
4. **Business Logic**: Service layer processes the request according to business rules
5. **Data Access**: Repository layer interacts with databases through provider interfaces
6. **Provider Interaction**: Providers communicate with external services (databases, APIs)
7. **Response Assembly**: Results are assembled into standardized response format
8. **Response Delivery**: HTTP response is sent back to the client

#### Security and Validation
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse through request rate limiting
