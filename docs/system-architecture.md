### 2. Service Interactions

Service interactions are designed to be efficient, reliable, and maintainable. The interaction patterns follow established enterprise patterns and best practices.

#### Interaction Patterns

**Service Orchestration**:
- Services coordinate complex business processes

- Transaction boundaries are clearly established

**Event-Driven Communication**:
- Services communicate through events for loose coupling
- Asynchronous processing for non-critical operations
- Event sourcing for audit trails and debugging
- Eventual consistency for distributed operations

**Circuit Breaker Pattern**:
- Services implement circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Graceful degradation when downstream services are unavailable
- Automatic recovery and health monitoring
- Fallback strategies for critical operations

#### Performance Optimization

**Caching Strategies**:

### Service Design Principles

#### Domain-Driven Design
- **Bounded Contexts**: Each service operates within a well-defined domain boundary
- **Domain Models**: Rich domain models that encapsulate business logic
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Consistent terminology across service interfaces
- **Aggregate Roots**: Clear entity relationships and transaction boundaries

#### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Services are open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Service interfaces can be substituted without breaking clients
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients depend only on interfaces they use
- **Dependency Inversion**: Services depend on abstractions, not concretions

#### Error Handling and Resilience

## Database Architecture

The database architecture of the University Chatbot system is designed for scalability, performance, and data integrity. The system uses a hybrid approach combining relational data management with vector search capabilities, providing both transactional consistency and advanced semantic search features.

### Database Design Philosophy

The database architecture follows several key principles:

- **Single Source of Truth**: All data has a clear primary location and ownership
- **ACID Compliance**: Critical operations maintain transactional consistency
- **Scalability**: Schema and indexes designed for horizontal and vertical scaling
- **Performance**: Optimized queries and efficient data access patterns
- **Extensibility**: Schema can evolve without breaking existing functionality
- **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive constraints and validation rules

### 1. Database Schema

The database schema is organized around core business entities with clear relationships and well-defined boundaries. The schema supports both operational workloads and analytical queries.

#### Core Entities

```

### 2. Data Access Pattern

The data access pattern implements the Repository pattern to provide a clean abstraction between the business logic and data persistence layers. This pattern enables testing, caching, and provider switching while maintaining data consistency.

### 3. Request/Response Patterns

The API implements consistent patterns for request processing and response formatting, ensuring predictable and reliable interactions.

#### Request Processing Flow

**Request Lifecycle**:
1. **Reception**: HTTP request received by FastAPI server
2. **CORS Check**: Cross-origin request validation
3. **Authentication**: JWT token validation and user context extraction
4. **Rate Limiting**: Request rate validation and throttling
5. **Validation**: Request body and parameter validation
6. **Routing**: Request routing to appropriate endpoint handler
7. **Business Logic**: Service layer processing
8. **Response**: JSON response formatting and delivery

**Error Handling Strategy**:
- **Structured Errors**: Consistent error response format across all endpoints
- **Error Codes**: Application-specific error codes in addition to HTTP status codes
- **Detail Messages**: Human-readable error descriptions for debugging
- **Validation Errors**: Detailed field-level validation error information

**Response Format Standardization**:
- **Success Responses**: Consistent success response structure
- **Metadata**: Request ID, timestamp, and processing time in responses
- **Pagination**: Standardized pagination format for list endpoints
- **Links**: HATEOAS-style links for related resources where appropriate

#### Response Format Examples

**Standard Success Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { /* response data */ },
  "metadata": {
    "request_id": "uuid",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "processing_time_ms": 150
  }
}
```

**Paginated Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [/* array of items */],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "page_size": 20,
    "total_items": 100,
    "total_pages": 5
  },
  "metadata": { /* standard metadata */ }
}
```

**Error Response**:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Request validation failed",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "email",
        "message": "Invalid email format"
      }
    ]
  },
  "metadata": { /* standard metadata */ }
}
```

### 2. Request/Response Flow

The request/response flow demonstrates how HTTP requests are processed through the entire middleware stack and business logic layers, ensuring proper handling at every stage.

#### Detailed Request Processing

**Client Request Initiation**:
- Client applications (web, mobile, API clients) send HTTP requests
- Requests include authentication tokens, request bodies, and query parameters
- Client libraries handle request formatting and error handling

**Middleware Processing Pipeline**:
1. **CORS Validation**: Check origin, methods, and headers against CORS policy
2. **Request Parsing**: Parse HTTP headers, body, and query parameters
3. **Authentication**: Validate JWT tokens and extract user context
4. **Rate Limiting**: Check request rate against user/IP limits
5. **Request Logging**: Log request details for monitoring and debugging
6. **Input Validation**: Validate request structure using Pydantic models

**Business Logic Execution**:
- **Route Resolution**: FastAPI router determines appropriate handler
- **Dependency Injection**: Inject required services and dependencies
- **Service Processing**: Execute business logic through service layer
- **Data Access**: Perform database operations through repository layer
- **External Calls**: Interact with LLM providers and external services

**Response Generation**:
- **Result Formatting**: Format response according to API standards
- **Metadata Addition**: Add request metadata and processing information
- **Error Handling**: Convert exceptions to structured error responses
- **Response Compression**: Compress response if beneficial and supported

#### Error Handling and Recovery

**Error Classification**:
- **Client Errors (4xx)**: Invalid requests, authentication failures, validation errors
- **Server Errors (5xx)**: Internal failures, external service unavailability, database errors
- **Business Logic Errors**: Domain-specific errors like insufficient permissions

**Error Recovery Strategies**:
- **Graceful Degradation**: Provide partial functionality when services are unavailable

- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascading failures by temporarily disabling failing services
- **Fallback Responses**: Provide default responses when primary processing fails

**Error Monitoring and Alerting**:
- **Error Rate Monitoring**: Track error rates and patterns across endpoints
- **Alert Thresholds**: Automatic alerts when error rates exceed thresholds
- **Error Logging**: Comprehensive error logging with context and stack traces
- **User Feedback**: Error responses that help users understand and resolve issues
